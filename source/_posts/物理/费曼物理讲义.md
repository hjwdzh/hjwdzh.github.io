## 原子与运动

1. 原子论：物质是由原子构成的——历史上最重要的假设。
2. 空气/热/压力：密度大小<->原子撞击/原子速度
3. 水蒸气的挥发
4. 晶体溶解

## 基础物理介绍
```
At first the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes ... find the laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes
```
- < 1920s: 3-dimensional + Euclid + Time.
1. Inertia. force -> atomic + gravitation. motion.
2. Electricity -> nucleus + electrons, nucleus -> protons + neutrons
3. force -> Electricity field
4. electromagnetic field/wave

- > 1920s: quantum physics
1. space-time
2. quantum mechanics
3. wave <-> particle
4. quantum electrodynamics -> electromagnetic field with photon (except for nucleus) -> properties of gamma rays, positron / antiparticle
5. require two numbers -> mass / charge
```
it is fundamentally impossible to make a precise prediction of exactly what will happen. We can find only an average, statistically, as to what happens
```
- Necleis
1. Discovered new particles $\mu$-meson. $\pi$-meson (muon, pion): cannot explain forces between protons and neutrons.
2. 30 particles from cosmic rays.
3. baryon-meson-lepton / the photon and the graviton. baryon -- neucleus, meson -- neuclear interaction
```
in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity.
```
## Energy
- Energy: sum of several **forms**
- gravitation/kinetic/heat/elastic/electrical/chemical/radiant/nuclear/mass

## Time and Distance
### Time
- Galileo, measure time with pulse, distance proportional to square of time
- small pieces of time, pendulum (Galileo) -> electornic occilators -> caibrate with **electron-beam oscilloscope** -> modern $10^{−12}$ sec. (light amplifier) -> $10^{-16}$ sec. ($\pi$-meson lifetime)
```
time, periordic measurement
```
- open question to infinitesimal time
- long time: **use of radioactive material**
```
> the radioactivity of a particular sample of material decreases by the same fraction for successive equal increases in its age
```
- open question to time before the universe
- standard time: earch day -> atomic clock

### Distance
- Long measurement: triangulation, baseline, brightness
- Short measurement: electron microscope (small-scale triangulation) -> $10^{-10}$m. Neclear dimension by effective cross section -> $10^{-15}$m.
- Errors in measurement: time-energy, distance-momentum
